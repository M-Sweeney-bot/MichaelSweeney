          <p>
            I began at the University of Illinois as an engineering physics student, drawn to the awe and creativity of physics and engineering. Over time, I discovered that my work wasn't going to be as marvelous or celestial as I thought. Three-fourths of my life in college I realized there's enough magic here on earth between humans—no need to consult galaxies or molecules for that.
          </p>

          <p>
            I pivoted into journalism late in college and went all in—student newspaper, NPR affiliate, broadcast newsroom—learning to tell stories with clarity, care, and urgency. As a journalist, I became a student of human communication and connection through intimate interviews, school board meetings, fierce yet peaceful protests, and leagues of passionate storytellers I was lucky to call my peers.
          </p>

          <p>
            I treasured my role as an observer, but now I want to take action. I'm looking to help others with what I've learned and will continue to do so as a freelance journalist. I will not stop my work, but I will evolve it.
